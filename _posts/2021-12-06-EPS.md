# Emission Pricing Systems
In today's ever changing technological age, it has become increasingly difficult to propose solutions to current or near-future problems. Even more so because our current challenges do not only involve high technological requirements and investments, but also the public's consensus. Such is the case for environmental emissions in transportation. 

It is no mystery that our current transportation systems suffer from congestion and inefficiencies all which have [environmental and health consequences for the public](https://www.epa.gov/mobile-source-pollution/research-health-effects-exposure-risk-mobile-source-pollution). In fact,  nearly [30% of all greenhouse gas emissions are a consequence of vehicles and traffic congestion](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions) . Furthermore, the emissions are also correlated with significant health effects such as [asthma and deadly seizures](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/vehicle-pollution-causes-4-million-new-child-asthma-cases-every-year). Not only that, but the [vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the US have consistently increased since 1971](https://afdc.energy.gov/data/10315), and some models predict that new emerging technologies such as autonomous vehicles may [increase the VMTs as high as 60%](https://www.fehrandpeers.com/autonomous-vehicle-research/). 

Provided these historical trends and future projections, it is clear that the current transportation system requires some intervention if our goal is to reverse any of the aforementioned trends. Many have proposed emission pricing systems (EPS) or [emission trading systems (ETS)](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/pricing-carbon) which seek to put the responsibility of the potential environmental damage on those directly responsible for it. This can be accomplished by either capping the total level of greenhouse gas emissions allowed by means of providing limited number of permits; and/or by creating a pollution tax by setting a price on the carbon content of fossil fuels.  In this way, people would have to pay per-unit consumption instead of paying for a flat rate to acquire permits. These methods hope to discourage people from using high polluting modes of transportation and encourage a sustainable transportation system. 

Yet, while taxing users sounds like a fair solution on the roads, the feasibility is still in question. For instance, questions such as what the main barriers for implementing EPS are, or what the best system to promote sustainable transportation is are still open to debate. In fact, many of these question arise when breaching the gap between theory to practice and need careful examination from experts in multidisciplinary backgrounds. This would ensure not only that the goal of reducing emissions is reached, but that the goal is reached in an equitable and sustainable way. 


## Barriers Toward Regulation and EPS Implementation
In an ideal world, the government would simply track people's driving behavior, mileage, and daily activity, and everyone would simply pay exactly what their carbon footprint represents. However, this is very infeasible due to the increasing concerns of privacy violations and cyber security breaches. In fact, the technology to implement EPS exists today and should not be more complex than any already-existing GPS app such as Google Maps or Waze. Nonetheless, one of the biggest challenges is instead the public opinion. 

The public involvement highlights the main paradox related the applicability of an EPS.  On one hand, evidence from gas taxation suggests that people would [reduce their travels if an emission tax were to be implemented](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w17891/w17891.pdf). Furthermore, in economics theory, there is a phenomenon called [The Zero Price Effect](https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/zero-price-effect/) which suggests that the demand for a particular service or product would substantially decrease if the service transitions from being free to having a nonzero (even if negligible) fee. This further suggests that the transportation demand, related personal vehicles, would decrease if emissions taxes or any EPS were to be implemented. Then, the question is, Why would this be a paradox if the emission tax would exactly accomplish the goal of reducing emissions? The unfortunate answer is democracy.

It turns out that it is very difficult to convince people to pay for a service that once was free, especially one that for many cannot be replaced. In fact, even in favorable political and ideological circumstances, [people still have shown hesitation when voting in favor of a carbon tax](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/07/139174/people-will-never-vote-for-a-carbon-tax-so-lets-stop-asking/) . This is where the paradox exists: Even when the negative health and environmental consequences affect everyone and there are data-driven methodologies to achieve the emission goals, people have to first vote in favor of such methodology before they can see its fruition. In other words, regular people, people who are not experts nor are familiar with the subject, have to be convinced that an EPS is indeed the best course of action. The challenge arises because there are psychological barriers  which affect people's sense of urgency regarding the climate change and the environmental consequences of their actions. Therefore, they do not see an immediate benefit for paying extra taxes, while they see immediate downfalls. In particular, the [American Psychological Association cites the following barriers](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2009/08/climate-change):

> -   **Uncertainty** – Research has shown that uncertainty over climate change reduces the frequency of “green” behavior.
> -    **Mistrust** – Evidence shows that most people don’t believe the risk messages of scientists or government officials
> -   **Denial** – A substantial minority of people believe climate change is not occurring or that human activity has little or nothing to do with it, according to various polls.
> -  **Undervaluing Risks** – A study of more than 3,000 people in 18 countries showed that many people believe environmental conditions will worsen in 25 years. While this may be true, this thinking could lead people to believe that changes can be made later.
> -  **Lack of Control** – People believe their actions would be too small to make a difference and choose to do nothing.
> -   **Habit** – Ingrained behaviors are extremely resistant to permanent change while others change slowly. Habit is the most important obstacle to pro-environment behavior, according to the report.

Given that the these psychological barriers, governments and policy makers must focus on educational campaigns, focusing on communicating the science behind their policy and providing purpose to their means to achieve their goals. In this way, policy makers may be better off by implementing slow progressive policies towards a more sustainable future rather than trying to radically pass high carbon taxes which have already shown to receive push back. 

## EPS in Practice
Now that the barriers have been identified, a challenge remains. How would an EPS look in practice? Although this [still an open question](https://www.wri.org/insights/carbon-tax-vs-cap-and-trade-whats-better-policy-cut-emissions), it is suggested that pricing rather than cap-and-trade system would be more effective in reducing emissions.

Some have suggested a [VMT tax](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/interactive/2021/electric-mileage-tax/) which would charge people according to a driver's VMT per year and considering the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.  This has major [implementation challenges](https://www.fleetworthy.com/compliance-blog/what-is-the-proposed-vehicle-miles-traveled-vmt-tax/) and other environmental critiques. First, from a practical point of view, there would have to be an on-board vehicle device to capture the distance through GPS units which could be costly and intrusive. Even if there is a more naïve and effective  procedure to account for VMT such as having a certified center officially checking people's odometers, the government would still need to check [hundreds of millions of vehicles](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183505/number-of-vehicles-in-the-united-states-since-1990/) yearly. This, without accounting for possible fraudulent odometer readings, presents major logistical challenges. There are also equity issues regarding families which cannot afford to live in the city and have long commutes without an alternate modes of transportation. Furthermore, by only accounting for VMT, this EPS would ignore the difference between urban and rural travel. Studies have shown that [rural travelers travel significantly longer distance than urban travelers](https://vtc.rutgers.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Articles.Urban-Rural_differences.pdf) especially when comparing low-income families. Moreover, the miles traveled in urban areas are likely miles traveled under congestion which has been shown to [produce higher emissions and severe health effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4243514/).  Hence, although the VMT tax would discourage people from traveling, it still has political, technological and social challenges to overcome. 

Another option is to apply a more "decentralized" approach. Instead of trying to tax every car user in the U.S. equally, regardless of their rural or urban context or their contribution to congestion, urbanized environments can be the primary focus. This is highly related to [congestion pricing](https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestionpricing/cp_what_is.htm) which seeks to shift demand to alternate paths or modes of transportation by charging users typically during rush hours. Although this was originally thought as a congestion management strategy in large cities, it can very well be adapted for environmental purposes due to their intrinsic relationship. For instance, researchers have suggested [distance-dependent congestion pricing for downtown zones](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275060400_Distance-dependent_congestion_pricing_for_downtown_zones), which would charge users for entering downtown areas and would consider a distance-based fee, instead of a flat toll as it is usually charged. Cameras in urban areas could determine the level of congestion and therefore a per-mile fee which would depend on the congestion level, the vehicle fuel efficiency, and the total distance traveled by the user in the area. Most of the technology to make such tolls possible are already in place, such as cameras, license plate detectors, and congestion monitoring. Such congestion pricing policies have had [success internationally](https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/fhwahop08047/02summ.htm) in places such as Singapore, London, and Stockholm which have seen benefits such as congestion reduction, emission reduction, and revenue generation. 

Another effective alternative for reducing carbon footprint and also help the implementation of EPS is to enhance alternative modes of transportation. It is well known that other modes of transportation such as public transit and biking can help in [reducing people's carbon footprint ](https://www.epa.gov/transportation-air-pollution-and-climate-change/what-you-can-do-reduce-pollution-vehicles-and). Given the current public transit conditions in the U.S., directly enforcing an emission's tax may feel like people are either being forced to pay an extra tax or forced to not travel. However, if alterative and competitive modes of transportation exist, the public may be more receptive to adopt EPS because they could seamlessly switch to other more environmentally friendly modes. Hence, one way to promote EPS and persuade the public may be to propose both transit enhancement programs along with an EPS proposal. This could potentially give purpose to the extra taxation, while the public can observe a tangible outcome which otherwise could not be observed by only focusing on the environmental impacts of the reduced car travel. 

## Closing Remarks
The implementation of emission pricing systems are still an open area of research and the questions of what is the best way to implement them are still open. Due to the current hesitation from U.S. voters for a carbon tax or EPS, it is likely that the best course of action is to gradually implement policies which will set the U.S. in the right direction rather than attempting to change the whole system at once. Otherwise, escaping the paradox arising from the contrast between the scientific evidence and public opinion may not be possible. Implementing policies such as congestion pricing and transit enhancement programs in selected urbanized environments can also help the U.S. public to see the benefits of such tolls or taxation in a tangible way so they can make more informed decisions in future policy proposals.
