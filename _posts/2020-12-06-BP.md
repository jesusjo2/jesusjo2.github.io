# The Braess Paradox

In “‘The cars just disappeared': What happened to the 90,000 cars a day the viaduct carried before it closed?” article in _The Seattle Times_, David Gutman explains that commute times were slightly above average when the Alaskan Way Viaduct was closed but were less than traffic predictions. In the article, Gutman explains that Interstate Highway I-5 passing through Seattle went from 279,000 cars a day to 294,000 cars a day. When comparing the 15,000-car increase on I-5 to the 90,000 cars a day on the viaduct, there are several cars that are missing.

 Therefore, one may be wondering what happened to the other cars. The article goes on to describe that some people are preferring to use other forms of transportation, such as bikes, buses, light rail, commuter rail, and water taxis. However, these other forms of transportation did not result in a difference in ridership that was closer to 90,000 cars.

 This idea of adding a new travel route that can increase travel time or remove a travel route that can reduce the travel time is known as Braess Paradox. It seems like there is a paradox since travel time is often expected to increase when the road capacity decreases, or the travel time is expected to decrease when the road capacity increases. The science of this paradox can best be explained by using vehicle flows and travel times. In a given road network, users often choose the routes that have the lowest travel time when possible. When a traffic network is being analyzed, it can be said to exhibit user-equilibrium conditions when no user (or driver) is better off switching routes to go from an origin to a destination. When considering this equilibrium, an example of Braess can be explained as follows:

 Considering the Seattle network shown in Figure 1, imagine that on a given weekend, 1800 cars per hour need to go from Lumen Field to the Space Needle. Route A entails using 4th Avenue to go from Lumen Field to the Space Needle and route B entails using I-5, Mercer Street, and 5th Avenue. Assuming that these are the only vehicle on the road, the travel times for both routes can be defined as 11 minutes plus the product of 0.005 and traffic in vehicles per hour. Given that the travel times of both routes are equal, it is assumed that 900 cars will travel on both routes, making the travel time of each route 15.5 minutes for a total of 31 minutes. Then, route C, which uses the old Alaskan Way Viaduct, Mercer Street, and 5th Avenue to go from Lumen Field to the Space Needle is included in the network with travel time equal to the product of 2 plus the product 0.02 and traffic on the route. Since this route initially has a very low travel time, users from routes A and B pick route C until all the routes have the same travel time at 14 minutes, and have traffic equally split (600 cars per hour for each route). Hence, the total travel time for these three routes combined is 42 minutes. This total travel time is an 11-minute increase from the previous one, showing that the addition of a new route leads to greater travel times throughout the network.

 If one were to consider a situation in which some users would not travel if travel times on any given route were to exceed 14 minutes, then one could see that routes A and B together would have 1200 cars per hour if route C were to be removed under this situation. With the inclusion of route C, there would be 1800 cars per hours. Hence, one can conclude that Braess paradox is explained by the idea that if there are more and initially better options to go from an origin to a destination, people will use that option until it is equivalent to any other option. When an option is removed, people will resort to the other options available, and some may consider that traveling overall is not worth it.
